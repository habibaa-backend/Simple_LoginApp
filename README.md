# SimpleLoginApp

This is my first project on GitHubâ€”a simple console application built with C# and SQL Server. 
The application demonstrates a basic user login functionality,
connecting to a SQL Server database to validate user credentials.
It serves as a practical exercise in integrating C# with SQL Server, utilizing ADO.NET for database operations.

## Features:
- User authentication against a SQL Server database.
- Secure implementation using parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Utilizes Integrated Security with Windows authentication for simplicity.

## About This Project:
As my first GitHub project, SimpleLoginApp represents my initial steps into the world of software development and version control. I'm eager to learn, improve, and contribute more to the developer community. This project marks the beginning of my journey in building and sharing code with others.
